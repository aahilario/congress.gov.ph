</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>ABSTRACT : Intends to address the fact that there is no sovereign digital currency in national circulation yet but only a patchwork of digital payment platforms and electronic money systems operated by private entities such as bank.
Proposes to fill the gap by mandating the creation, adoption and perfection of a BSDP which is a digital sovereign-or central bank-backed digital currency equivalent of the paper peso in all its denominations and which shall be divisible up to one (1) centavo,  which possesses all the characteristics and attributes of a valid legal tender.
Provides that the BSP shall explore and study the technology of blockchain and post-blockchain cryptocurrencies to expand its knowledge base which it will use in deciding what can utilize for the BSDP, using a peer to peer system to verify its log chain.
