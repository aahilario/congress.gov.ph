Intends therefore the regulation of the petroleum industry through the creation of an independent, quasi-judicial regulatory body to be named  as Petroleum Regulatory Council (PRC); and a trust	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      fund  which shall be designated as the Oil Price Buffer Fund (OPBF)  which shall serve to cushion the impact on consumers against drastic increases in petroleum prices.
