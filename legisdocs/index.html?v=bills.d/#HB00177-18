Seeks to remove the distinction on whether fermented liquors are brewed and sold in microbreweries and pubs or in factories for simpler administration.
Intends that to further simplify the tax administration on spirits, the tax shall be based on volume or 
per liter and no longer on "per proof liter", the incremental revenues that will be generated will fund
social services and infrastructure programs of the government.
