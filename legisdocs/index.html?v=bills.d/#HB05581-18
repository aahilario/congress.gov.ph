Proposes to create the National Authority for Child Care (NACC), a one stop shop on alternative child care attached to the DSWD - reorganizing the Inter Country Adoption Board (ICAB); and makes adoption administrative in nature to effectively streamline adoption procedures and make formal adoption accessible.

Provides for other forms of alternative child care such as guardianship, khafallah, kinship care,
or residential care.
