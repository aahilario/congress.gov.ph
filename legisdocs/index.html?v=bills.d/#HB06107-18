Proposes to strengthen the law by amending certain provisions so that "sexual harassment" now constitutes:
a) acts that are not only physical or verbal in nature, but also those committed using electronic devices or any available technology or means; b) acts that have been committed either within or outside the place of employment, training or education; and c) offensive remarks about a person's sexual orientation.
