Philippines having the highest corporate income tax rate in the ASEAN region but having the lowest collection efficiency because of very generous tax incentives that are given in perpetuity and in lieu of other taxes;\r\nb. The country's investment tax incentive system is very complex which result in a system that is less transparent, less targeted, not time-bound, and not performance-based;\r\nc. Tax Code is outdated which lacks adequate provisions to address transfer pricing and other anti-avoidance practices; and\r\nd. Very little involvement by the DOF in the formulation and grant of tax incentives to the registered business enterprises, though it is the steward of the government's fiscal health and mandated to formulate sound fiscal policy.\r\n\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EROMERO, MICHAEL ODYLON L.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2019-07-29\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EMOTHER BILL:&nbspHB04157\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS ON 2019-08-05\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
