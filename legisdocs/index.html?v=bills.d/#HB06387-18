Proposes that if the reason for the dishonor of the check is the closure of the account, all the subsequent checks issued shall be deemed dishonored without the need of presentment; States that the penalty shall not be applicable for closure of accounts which are done in good faith or when the parties agreed in writing to revise the terms of payment.

Aims that the amended law will have more deterrent effect in issuing unfunded checks, and thereby significantly reduce the number of B.P.No.22 cases file in courts and to strengthen public confidence in checks as a negotiable instrument.
