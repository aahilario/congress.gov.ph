No.9184 due to evident-based manipulation or collusion which still exist in the bidding process in government procurement although the law clearly prohibits other attempts to subvert the said practice.

Mandates that bidders and contractors who participate in the public bidding or who deal with the government in the implementation of infrastructure projects, must operate within the area or region where the project is to be implemented and must secure an Authority to Participate from the Regional Director and the Undersecretary for Operations of the DPWH.
