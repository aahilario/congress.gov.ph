Seeks to amend the law to further promote organic agriculture, to make the law more appropriate for our country's food producers that include marginal farmers, municipal fisherfolk and micro, small and medium entrepreneurs.

Defines "Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS)", recognizes it in the certification and labeling of organic products and brings together the appropriate agencies and stakeholder groups to develop and strengthen such
alternative certification mechanisms, and likewise ensures the protection of indigenous organic resources against cross contamination of engineered crops.
