Intends to ensure that the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration in all actions 
concerning children, and that children shall be protected against all forms of discrimination.

Offers remedy to the existing provisions of Family Code where it discriminates against children conceived or born out of wedlock of parents who, at the time of the conception of the former were disqualified by an impediment to marry each other which is prejudicial against such "illegitimate" children who cannot and should not be faulted for their parent's marital impediment/s.
