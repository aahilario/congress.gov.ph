Bordado, in rejoicing over the President’s
crusade against illegal drugs and program to overhaul the Philippine railways system, among other things, expressed support thereto but emphasized the need to put in place systems and mechanisms to protect innocent and helpless people. He also underscored how the Philippine National Railways, which is vital to the development of his region, has remained in perpetual state of disrepair despite the huge amount of money that the national government
has allocated for its rehabilitation in the past.
As he commended the President for “walking the
extra mile” in his efforts to solve the insurgency problem, he reiterated his support for the Administration’s goal of achieving progress and peace through legislative measures.
