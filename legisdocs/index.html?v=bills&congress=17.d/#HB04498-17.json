The provision of funds for the needs of the MSME sector must be viewed with an expanded timeframe.\r\n3.\tInterposed no objection to the establishment of a P500 million Venture Capital Fund, however there is no separate implementing guidelines and selection criteria that must be set-up on the grant of the seed fund. A portion of the income generated from the interest of loans under the SB Corp.\u2019s Pondo sa Pagbabago and Pag-Asenso program should be allocated as Venture Capital Fund.\r\n4.\tThe Committee should request for the comments of the Government Commission for GOCCs (GCG), and the Department of Finance (DOF) with regard to the capitalization requirements of the SB Corp. \r\n\r\nIn summary, the DBM is constrained from favorably endorsing the proposed bill in its present form. \r\n\r\nIn reaction, Chairman Unabi requested the DBM to review its position, considering President Duterte\u2019s pronouncement in the recent ASEAN Economic Summit  that his administration will strongly support MSMEs, believing that they are the driving force for economic development. Reps. Jose Enrique Garcia III and Jocelyn S. Limkaichong echoed the President\u2019s statement that he will review the budget and increase the allocation for MSMEs.\r\n\r\nThe Committee approved the following additional amendments to the bill:\r\n\r\n1.\tDelete the phrase \u201cin the amount of Five Hundred Million Pesos (P500,000,000.00)\u201d as itemized contribution by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP); and\r\n2.\tDefine the term \u201csmaller banks\u201d, with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) tasked to craft the language.
