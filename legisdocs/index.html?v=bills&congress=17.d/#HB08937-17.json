No.10591, to bring it in line with more stringent standards of gun regulation, and clarifies certain provisions that have led to unreasonable applications of the law with regard to loose bullets, by making the existing licensing procedure as rigorous as possible.\r\n\r\nProposes several revisions and additional requirements as regards to application of license: \r\na. certification from current place of employment regarding any record of past disciplinary infractions;\r\nb. consent from all other adult members of the applicant's household;\r\nc.  Application stating the personal circumstance of the applicant and his\/her reason why ownership of the firearm is sought;\r\nd. Applicant's psychiatric test which shall factor in the disciplinary records from his\/her place of work, if any;\r\ne.
