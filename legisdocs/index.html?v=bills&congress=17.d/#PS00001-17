Belmonte ( F.)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>ABSTRACT : In nominating Rep. Pantaleon D. Alvarez from the
First District of Davao del Norte to be the Speaker of the 17th Congress, Rep. Belmonte cited his personal and professional relationship with the former who was a Member of the 11th Congress and then the Secretary of Transportation and Communications under the administration of former President Gloria MacapagalArroyo. He stressed that the nation should grant the incoming Speaker the same overwhelming mandate it gave to President Rodrigo Duterte.

important measures because the Members’ sense of
nationalism will always prevail over their political and personal interests. He committed the Liberal Party’s support for the quest for change which, while not easy, could be achieved through consensus and compromise. He opined that Rep. Alvarez (P.) will ensure that Congress will work together with President Duterte to achieve the people’s aspirations and welfare.
