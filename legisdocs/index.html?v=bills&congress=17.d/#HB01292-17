Deliberated upon by the Mother Committee on 2017-08-08</b><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-The Committee approved the measure subject to certain amendments and style.  The Committee referred to the Reference and Research Bureau (RRB) the measure for its constitutionality.  On September 7, 2017, the RRB submitted its opinion on the measure.  The RRB opinion stated that, “The proposed bill enjoining MERALCO to implement Prepaid Electrification System in the Lone District of San Jose del Monte, Bulacan is of doubtful constitutionality as it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution. There is no valid classification that differentiates San Jose del Monte, Bulacan from other local government units desiring the same service.  The bill, if enacted into law, will not apply equally to all the local government units similarly situated.  The equal protection clause provides a guaranty against any form of undue favoritism or hostility from the government.” 

The Committee furnished a copy of the RRB opinion to Representative Robes.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY ON 2016-08-01</td></tr></table>
