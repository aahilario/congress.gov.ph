Bondoc,\r\nRep. Salvador B. Belaro Jr. from Party-List 1-\r\nAng Edukasyon focused on President Duterte\u2019s recent statement that the party-list system has been abused and has become a mockery of the law. He noted that said comment was followed by ascerbic bashings of the system in Facebook and social media that prompted supporters of his party-list group to issue a statement in defense of its members. He added that on behalf of 1-Ang Edukasyon Party-List, he took exception to the President\u2019s opinion and stressed that his\r\nparty-list group\u2019s presence in Congress is not a mockery of the law. This, as he underscored the following points: 1) around 278,693 Filipinos voted for his party-list organization because they believe in its intention and platform in the field of education; 2) the party-list system is an equalizing measure and a legal innovation in sync with the democratization of power and promotion of social justice; 3) his group\u2019s nominees\r\nin the last party-list elections were self-made persons who are pillars of the education sector; and 4) he had filed 30 bills and resolutions fostering, empowering, and protecting education, among others. He then urged his fellow party-list Representatives to respond accordingly to what he referred to as \u201ca crisis in the image of the party-list system in general,\u201d by 1) educating the public on the importance of the system, 2) showcasing its accomplishments thus far; and 3) raising the bar of what previous party-list\r\ngroups in Congress have done.\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.5,p.49) \r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EBELARO, SALVADOR JR.
