Recommendations submitted by the TWG on 2017-09-26</b><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Committee Chairman Peter Unabia underscored one salient provision of the Magna Carta for MSMEs,  which is the mandatory allocation of credit resources for MSMEs, wherein at least 8% of the loan portfolio of all lending institutions shall be allocated for micro and small enterprises, and at least 2% for medium enterprises for a period of 10 years from the date of the effectivity of RA 9501.  The said mandatory lending will expire in June 2018, thus the need to extend the same.

Rep. Jose Enrique Garcia III presented the report of the Technical Working Group (TWG) which met on August 8 and 29, 2017 to consolidate and fine-tune the provisions of the subject bills.  He discussed the amendments to the law, as contained in the draft substitute bill, among which are:

6.	Provision by the National Government (NG), through the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), of additional paid-in capital to SB Corp. in the amount of at least P3 Billion within one (1) year and additional equities of P1 Billion a year thereafter for the next three (3) years;
7.	Additional authorized capital stock of P2 Billion, of which P1 Billion will be established from a pool of funds to be contributed by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), GSIS and Social Security System (SSS);
8.	Extension to another ten (10) years of the mandatory allocation of credit resources for  MSMEs;
9.	Increase in the penalties for non-compliance with the mandatory lending; and
10.	Submission by the MSMED Council to the Congress of the Philippines of an annual report on the status of the penalties remitted and the utilization thereof.

The Committee deferred approval of the substitute bill, pending the submission by the DBM of its official position paper, and review of the Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) on the penal provisions of the law.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Presentation of the Draft Substitute Bill on House Bill No. 4498, introduced by Rep. Maximo B. Rodriguez, Jr.,  and House Bill No. 5540,  introduced by Reps. Michael L. Romero and Enrico A. Pineda, re: Amendments to the Magna Carta for MSMEs</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Recommendations submitted by the TWG on 2017-11-27</b><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Committee Chairman Peter Unabia stated that the approval of the substitute bill, which was reported out by the Technical Working Group (TWG), was deferred during the last committee meeting held on September 26, 2017 for the following reasons:

1.	Awaiting submission of the position paper of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).
2.	Further review of the Penal Provisions of the proposed substitute bill, together with the IRR of the law on the sanctions.

In its unofficial position on the bill, the DBM representative, Assistant Secretary Grace delos Santos, stated that:

1.	The national government should not incur additional costs for the establishment of a guarantee system for distressed enterprises;
2.	The amount and timeframe in the proposed bill to fully finance the authorized capital of Small Business Corporation (SB Corp.) is not economically practical or efficient stating that the funds may be utilized for other priority programs and projects. The provision of funds for the needs of the MSME sector must be viewed with an expanded timeframe.
3.	Interposed no objection to the establishment of a P500 million Venture Capital Fund, however there is no separate implementing guidelines and selection criteria that must be set-up on the grant of the seed fund. A portion of the income generated from the interest of loans under the SB Corp.’s Pondo sa Pagbabago and Pag-Asenso program should be allocated as Venture Capital Fund.
4.	The Committee should request for the comments of the Government Commission for GOCCs (GCG), and the Department of Finance (DOF) with regard to the capitalization requirements of the SB Corp. 

In summary, the DBM is constrained from favorably endorsing the proposed bill in its present form. 

In reaction, Chairman Unabi requested the DBM to review its position, considering President Duterte’s pronouncement in the recent ASEAN Economic Summit  that his administration will strongly support MSMEs, believing that they are the driving force for economic development. Reps. Jose Enrique Garcia III and Jocelyn S. Limkaichong echoed the President’s statement that he will review the budget and increase the allocation for MSMEs.

The Committee approved the following additional amendments to the bill:

1.	Delete the phrase “in the amount of Five Hundred Million Pesos (P500,000,000.00)” as itemized contribution by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP); and
2.	Define the term “smaller banks”, with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) tasked to craft the language. This is to categorize and differentiate middle banks from small banks and thrift banks.

The Committee approved the substitute bill, subject to amendments, with all the members present even in the past meetings thereon, to be included as co-authors.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Consideration and Approval of the Draft Substitute Bill on House Bill No. 4498, introduced by Rep.
