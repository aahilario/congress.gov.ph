ENRIQUE GARCIA, JR'S VISION OF EMPOWERMENT FOR LGUs: A PRELUDE TO FEDERALISM</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>SHORT TITLE : Honoring The Late Tet Garcia</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>ABSTRACT : Rep. Garcia rose to pay homage to his father, the
late former Bataan Congressman and Governor
Enrique “Tet” T. Garcia Jr. or fondly known as 
Congressman Tet. He then related to the Body
Congressman Tet’s tenacity in pursuing worthy
national causes and issues during his tenure as Bataan governor and district representative. One of those issues, he continued, was the gross injustice perpetrated by the national government against local government units (LGUs), especially concerning the implementation of an erroneous provision of the 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) wherein LGUs are getting their Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) shares in amounts that are much less than what the law provides. He pointed out that it was Congressman Tet who saw, heard and felt the crying need of the LGUs for empowerment and judicial relief and appealed to the government to do what is right and just. He lamented, however, that Congressman Tet’s plea was
ignored and that the government has continued to
retain the funds for its own use, as in the case of the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).
As the new leadership has taken the reign of
government, he cited to the Body his father’s
unspoken message to President Rodrigo Roa Duterte
on the issue of federalism. He stressed that his
father’s vision of empowering the LGUs is the fast
and simple solution to the problem of inequitable
distribution of the country’s national wealth. He then urged President Duterte to direct the Departments of Finance (DOF), Budget and Management (DBM) and the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) to recompute the IRA in accordance with Section 284 of the LGC and relieve the LGUs from awaiting the Supreme Court decision on the IRA petition. In closing, he underscored that said funds due the LGUs will solve underspending that was cited as the reason for the deceleration of the nation’s economic growth.
