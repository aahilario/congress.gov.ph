Ramon V.A.“RAV” Rocamora ... spoke about the need to continue the past administration’s program on participatory budgeting or bottomup-budgeting (BuB) which is planned to be removed from the proposed 2017 national budget. He expressed 
gladness that many members of the civil society and local government officials spoke in defense of the BuB that eventually convinced the national government to give the program a second look including Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Ismael “Mike” Sueño who agreed to continue the projects that were products of exhaustive discussions and deliberations by communities. He hoped that the DILG will heed the sentiments of the local communities and local government units (LGUs)
which want to continue the program...In view thereof, he said that he had filed House Joint Resolution No. 4 calling for the restoration of the P35 billion allotted fund for BuB in the proposed 2017 national budget and asked the support of Rep. Karlo Alexei B. Nograles, as Chair of the Committee on Appropriations, as well as the Members of the 17th Congress to support the approval of the Joint Resolution.(SOURCE: House Journal No.21,p.14-15) </td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>ROCAMORA, RAMON V.A. &quot;RAV&quot;</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>DATE FILED : 2016-09-13</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>NATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>REMARKS:&nbspInterpellation by Rep.Villarin</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ON 2016-09-21</td></tr></table>
