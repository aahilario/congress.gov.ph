Bordado discussed the importance of the national budget especially the budgetary
allocation to the different government agencies for the delivery of basic services to the people;  stressed that ..., there is a need to examine
the absorptive capacities of all departments, assess the regional allocation of public investments, and review whether the allocation of resources has been done in a manner that no department or agency receives more resources at the expense of another; expressed concern on the budgetary cuts in the 2017 proposed budgets of the Departments of Health (DOH), and Agriculture (DA) ...; affirmed that the government must vigorously pursue the strategy of allocating resources to local government units (LGUs)...; urged Congress to ... to immediately craft the Budget Reform Act with the assistance of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM). INTERPELLATION OF REP. ANDAYA  With respect to the President’s promise of doubling the salaries of policemen, soldiers, teachers and other members of the civil bureaucracy, Rep. Andaya said that this would cost the government some P230 billion, and asked where this amount of money would be sourced... INTERPELLATION OF REP. MARCOLETA
Rep. Rodante D. Marcoleta ... noted that Rep. Bordado cited several areas where poverty incidence rate is so wide as compared to other areas, like the case of Central Luzon with a
poverty incidence rate of 11 to 12 percent, as compared to Mindanao, particularly the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) with a rate of
more than 50 percent.

He cited the case of the ARMM with a per capita income of about P11,000, as compared to that of the National Capital Region’s P219,000.00...(SOURCE: House Jornal No.15,pp.21-22)
