Further proposes to: retain the royalty rate of five percent (5%) for those currently located inside a mineral reservation, and a phased-in-rate for those outside such reservation; to retain the imposition of the corporate income tax (CIT); to impose an additional government share when the basic share is less than fifty percent (50%) of the net mining revenue.
Introduces thin capitalization in order for the businesses not to depend on excessive debt funding; and ring-fencing per project to prevent consolidation of income and expenses of all mining projects by the same taxpayer.
