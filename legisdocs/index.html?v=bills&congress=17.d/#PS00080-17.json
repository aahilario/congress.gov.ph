Castro took the floor to recognize the crucial role of teachers in society; to explain the history and rational\u00e9 behind the celebration of World Teachers Day on Oct.5 each year since 1996;and to discuss the UNESCO-ILO recommendations adopted in 1966 addressing several issues on the plight of teachers, such as professionalism, teacher training, and professional freedom. \r\nThereafter, the Lady Member talked about teaching being regarded as a profession and a form of public service which requires expertise, knowledge and specialized skills that are acquired and maintained through rigorous and continuous study. She then delved into the issue of the low salaries being paid to teachers in the country. After proposing to limit the class sizes to 35 students per class, Rep. Castro asked the Body to pass HB No.56 and other measures for the increase in teachers\u2019 salaries to decent and realistic levels because EO No. 201 provided for a very small salary increase.
