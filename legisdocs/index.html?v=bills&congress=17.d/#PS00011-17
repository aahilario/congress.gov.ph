Rogelio “Ruel” D.
Pacquiao from the Lone District of Sarangani initially thanked the people of his District for the overwhelming mandate they gave him in the last
elections, as well as the support of his elder brother, Senator Emmanuel “Manny” Pacquiao. He also congratulated Speaker Pantaleon D. Alvarez, a fellow Mindanaoan, as the Speaker of the 17th Congress of the House of Representatives. As a neophyte Member of the House, he said that he has committed himself to perform his constitutional
duty as legislator with utmost integrity, prudence, fidelity, and accountability. He stated that with his humble beginnings and experiences as barangay captain and city councilor, he can articulate the issues and aspirations of the people into meaningful legislative measures.
As one of the poorest provinces in Mindanao, he
cited the poverty issues facing Sarangani in terms of health and nutrition, water and sanitation, basic education, livelihood and income and expressed hope that he could bring these issues in the national level. He also enumerated several of his dreams for the Philippines. After expressing his wholehearted support to the agenda of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, Rep. Pacquiao urged his colleagues to scrutinize the National Expenditure Program for 2017 and the succeeding years to ensure that substantial budget for
poverty alleviation is allocated for the 20 poorest provinces of the country. In closing, Rep. Pacquiao expressed hope that his concerns will be given preferential attention by the leadership considering that Congress holds the power of the purse.
