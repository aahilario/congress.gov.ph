He expressed hope that it will be enacted in the 17th Congress.

The representatives from the concerned agencies and public sector unions, namely, the Civil Service Commission (CSC), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Cooperative Dev. Authority (CDA), Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP),  Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Confederation of Independent Unions in the Public Sector (CIU), Public Services Labor Independent Confederation (PSLINK) and Philippine Government Employees Association (PGEA) lauded the intent of the measure and manifested their full support therefor.    

	CSC proposed the inclusion in the bill of a provision to safeguard public interest since it is the agency’s understanding that the bill covers entrepreneurial activities of government employees while in-service.

Among the other comments and recommendations given were:

(1) DTI:  for the entrepreneurial skills development to be administered two years before retirement; for each agency to have in-house counselors/business tutors for retiring government employees, with the regular fund to be taken from the agency; and for the academe to be tapped in the Coordinating Council on Government Employees’ Entrepreneurship Development Program that will be created, as provided for in the bill; 

(2) LBP:   instead of creating the Council, for the CSC to spearhead the coordination among the concerned government agencies and the four public sector unions in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of a comprehensive plan for government employees’ entrepreneurial development;

(3) DBP:  for the inclusion of a provision that the financing of the entrepreneurial projects of government employees shall be dependent on the strength and quality of the proposed enterprise’s project and business cash flows, overall credit worthiness, and other mitigating measures, subject to due diligence, in order to  ensure the sustainability of funds of Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) which will be set aside for the purpose;

(4) PSLINK: to maintain a database of retirees, including their entrepreneurial engagements,  for accurate information and reference;  for a mandatory conduct of entrepreneurial and related seminar in all government agencies for its officials and employees as part of the agency’s annual training plan; and harmonization with the Go Negosyo Law; and 

(5) PGEA:  to also give emphasis on the follow-up programs after the retirees have set-up their business.

The representatives from GSIS, CIU and PGEA obliged to submit their official position papers within the week.

The Committee approved to convene a technical working group (TWG), to be chaired by Rep. Laogan, in order to fine-tune the provisions of the bill.  Rep.

Cooperatives and savings and loan associations shall be encouraged to retain the membership of employees even after retirement from public service.”

Participants shall be taught to identify and evaluate opportunities for new ventures and to understand how the capital investment process works. All GFIs shall set aside funds for this purpose: Provided, That financing of the entrepreneurial projects of retired government employees shall be dependent on the strength and quality of the proposed enterprise’s project and business cash flows, overall credit worthiness and other mitigating measures, in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, where applicable.”

The TWG likewise  agreed to adopt the recommendation of LBP on Section 7 for the CSC to spearhead the coordination among government agencies for the preparation, implementation and monitoring of a comprehensive plan for the government employees entrepreneurial development, as well as its funding sources, instead of creating a Council as provided for in the bill.  

Furthermore, Rep.

The CSC was requested to submit the agency’s confirmation on the afore-stated role of the CSC the following week.

Inputs were also made by the TWG in Sections 7, 8 and 9, which now read, to wit:

“SEC. 7.

“SEC. 8. Post-service Assistance. – All government agencies shall extend post-service assistance to their respective retirees and shall include this as part of their human resources development plan. They shall develop a post-service assistance program to backstop aspiring entrepreneurs in the development and implementation of their ideas. The program shall cover the entire gamut of the venture creation process from idea generation to building viable business, with emphasis on the nurturing roles of the GFIs, and highlighting successful entrepreneurs as models.
