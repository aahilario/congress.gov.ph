Bondoc, there being no
objection, the Chair recognized Rep. Raul V. Del Mar from the First District of Cebu City who questioned the withdrawal of Cebu City Mayor Tommy Osmeña’s deputation as a representative of the National Police Commission (Napolcom). After adverting to Republic Act No. 8551 which provides for the automatic deputation of governors and mayors as Napolcom agents and the grounds for the withdrawal of the same, he cited Napolcom Resolution No. 2016-467 enumerating Mayor Osmeña’s actions that were considered inimical to national security and the President’s peace and order campaign. He thereafter relayed one by one the City of Cebu’s refuting the allegations,
initially stating that what was stopped was not
the police officers’ allowances but their cash rewards that came from the mayor’s personal funds.
As he clarified Cebu City’s budgetary support to
the local police units, Rep. Del Mar stated that the Napolcom was grossly misinformed that Cebu City Mayor Osmeña was guilty of engaging in acts inimical to national security or which negate the effectiveness of the peace and order campaign. He also stated that neither he nor Rep. Rodrigo A. Abellanosa of the Second District of Cebu City was consulted by the Napolcom with regard to the withdrawal of Mayor Osmeña’s deputation. As such, he requested the House Committee on Local Government to investigate the legality and propriety of the Napolcom’s withdrawal of deputation of Mayor Osmeña. INTERPELLATION
OF REP. ABELLANOSA Reps. Abellanosa and Del Mar discussed the matter of the reward money given by Cebu City Mayor Osmeña and the pullout of his police escorts. They also delved into Cebu City’s budgetary support to the local police units which may have been the reason for the Napolcom’s resolution withdrawing Mayor Osmeña’s deputation as his actions were considered inimical to national security and the govenrment’s peace and order campaign. INTERPELLATION OF REP. ATIENZA
Reps. Atienza and Del Mar exchanged views on
the Napolcom’s stripping of Cebu City Mayor Osmeña’s police control; agreed that the principle of local autonomy allowing police control is enshrined in the Constitution and vital in the achievement of peace and order as now being pursued by President Duterte; supported Rep. Del Mar’s call for a congressional inquiry into the Napolcom as well as a review of the PNP Law; and expressed support to Mayor Osmena’s fight for his right to police control. Rep. Atienza then congratulated and reiterated his support to Rep. Del Mar and urged Congress to adhere to the intentions of the Constitution by respecting the
autonomy of the LGUs in allowing mayors full control and supervision of their local police force.
