Daza\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EABSTRACT : Rep. Daza, a member of the Liberal Party for half\r\na century and its President for five challenging years, nominated Rep. Teddy Brawner Baguilat Jr. from the Lone District of Ifugao Province as Speaker of the House of Representatives. For the record, he took pride in emphasizing that this was the first time that a Member who belongs to the so-called cultural minority was nominated to the highest office of the Chamber. He thereafter recalled Rep. Baguilat\u2019s political career\r\nand enumerated his achievements as a Governor and\r\nRepresentative of Ifugao Province. He underscored\r\nthat despite regionalism in the current political air, it is by sheer intent that he was nominating Rep. Baguilat because all the Members are first and foremost Filipinos, regardless of regional, religious and cultural background, and underscored his Party\u2019s hopes and ideals for the nation. \r\nSOURCE: House Journal No.1,p.16)\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EDAZA, RAUL A.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-07-25\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Others\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
