Suansing stated with pride that the\r\nProvince of Nueva Ecija is known as the rice granary of the Philippines because it is the top producer of rice, onion and other high-value crops. She however lamented the sad plight of the country\u2019s farmers which she said is aggravated by inadequate government support in the areas of microfinancing, research programs, and postharvest facilities. Zeroing in on the heavy burden imposed on farmers through mandatory payment of irrigation\r\nservice fees, she thereafter called on the House of Representatives to exercise its oversight functions and investigate the obscenely huge disparity in the rates of water fees paid by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) to CE Casecnan Water and Energy Company, Inc. and the water fees paid by First Gen to NIA to determine whether the national government is losing revenue from the contracts and agreements entered into by the NIA with these two corporations. She likewise suggested that to improve the country\u2019s agricultural industry, the government should not only level the playing field for the farmers\r\nand farm workers but should also strengthen its\r\nfinancial support through credit lines and subsidies. In closing, she said that the Members, as the elected Representatives of the people, have the avowed task and solemn obligation to ensure not only the farmer\u2019s well-being but more importantly to protect their right to justice.\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.7 pp.44-45) \r\n\r\n\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003ESUANSING, ESTRELLITA B.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-08\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND FOOD ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
