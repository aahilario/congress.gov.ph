Teves\u2019 privilege speech is a reminder to all\r\nhospitals ... that their priority mandate is to save lives and not to make profit. He gave this reminder in light of what just happened to one of his constituents who asked for his help in securing blood for her child who was down with dengue. He said that it was just fortunate that he was able to talk to a former classmate who was an officer at the Siliman University Medical Center so they were able to obtain blood bags ... which the blood donors used and bring the blood to the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital ... Rep. Teves was told earlier by Rep. Raul V. Del Mar that there was already a law prohibiting hospitals from not admitting patients without initial payment...\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.15,p.20)\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003ETEVES, ARNOLFO JR.
