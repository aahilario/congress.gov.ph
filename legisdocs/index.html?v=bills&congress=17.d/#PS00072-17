Bravo initially discussed the fiscal performance of past administrations starting from President Ferdinand E. Marcos to President Rodrigo Duterte, citing statistics on debts and budget deficits.  He then stressed the need to tackle the vicious cycle of borrowing and spending during the current budget process and pointed out that trillions of pesos are available in the national coffers to address the same as had been stated in the President’s budget message for 2017. He enumerated the government’s unused appropriations and stressed that it had failed to implement 
funded programs as well as asked why it had to resort to borrowings. He proposed that the Committees on Appropriations, and Ways and Means scrutinize how the funds could be used and consider the one-fund concept in government budgeting and accounting.
