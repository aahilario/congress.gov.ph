Roque spoke on the significance of the IHL which seeks to protect individuals and civilians who are not actively taking part in any armed conflict. He stated that the country has made strides in strengthening its commitment and adherence to the IHL by adopting laws such as Republic Act (RA) No. 9851 or the Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity, as well as ratifying conventions such as the 1948 Genocide Convention and its Additional Protocols. He pointed out however that the culture of impunity in the country and the serious violations on the IHL still continue especially on the impact of conflict to children and indigenous communities and the rise in the number of displaced persons due to conflict and\r\nviolence. In this regard, Rep. Roque said that he will file a proposed IHL Amendatory Act which seeks to address infirmities in RA No. 9851, as well as a proposed Philippine-ICC Cooperation Act aimed at facilitating compliance with the Philippines\u2019 obligations under the Rome Statute. As he stated that these bills were an output\r\nof the Technical Working Group (TWG) of the\r\nICC Implementation Project of the Institute of International Legal Studies of the U.P. Law Center, he thanked the members and experts of the TWG composed of the Institute of International Legal Studies UP Law Center, the UP College of Law; other government agencies; nongovernmental organizations and civil society groups. While Rep. Roque urged the Members to do their part in the fight against heinous crimes and to ensure\r\nsanctions against the most horrendous violations that can be committed in times of armed conflict, he also pointed out that it is in their power to help uphold the rule of law in the country and the system of international justice. He then greeted everyone a happy IHL Day. \r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.9,p.29)\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EROQUE, HARRY L.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-10\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN RIGHTS ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
