Lagman cited 12 major reasons which render
the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos unfit to be
buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani . . . Rep. Lagman pointed out that the then pervasive
nonchalance of most Filipinos to the homecoming of
Marcos’ remains has today been supplanted by a
growing opposition to the proposed Marcos burial at the Heroes’ Cemetery or the Libingan ng mga Bayani. He stated that among those opposed to the plan are the human rights advocates and families of victims of human rights violations during martial law. Considering that President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s predisposition to bury the late President Marcos in the Libingan ng mga Bayani is a gross departure from his previous statement during his SONA, Rep. Lagman said that the interment of Marcos’ remains in the Libingan ng mga Bayani is an undeserved reward and it is not a day of reckoning.
