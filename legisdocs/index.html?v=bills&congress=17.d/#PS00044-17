Batocabe delved on the recent development
on the war against drugs and what to do with the mass surrenderees. He averred that the drug rehabilitation issue would be better addressed by a comprehensive and sustainable plan that aims to establish additional drug rehabilitation centers strategically located in each legislative district of the country. As he cited more statistics, Rep. Batocabe said that what the government needs is to appropriate around P33 billion for the drug rehabilitation program as he remarked that it had allocated more than that amount for the Conditional Cash Transfer Program. He then
proposed to increase admissions in existing
rehabilitation centers; build additional centers or at least one center in each district; and consider the temporary use of military camps and government hospitals to treat drug dependents. He thereafter urged for a comprehensive and long-term plan on how to address the rehabilitation of the drug dependents and that the war against drugs should include saving lives and protecting the welfare and rights of the people.
