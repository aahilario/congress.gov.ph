Uybarreta to resolve issues vis-Ã -vis the PowerSolv recommendation and the individual and actual situation of electric cooperatives on the ground.

The Committee on Energy reverted the draft substitute bill on the System Loss Cap to the TWG to further study (1) the clustering of Private Distribution Utilities (PDUs) and Electric Cooperatives (ECs) as provided under Section 4 thereof; and (2) the timelines in the issuance of ERC decisions on the Distribution Utilities (DUs) Application for the use of individualized system loss cap and Implementing Rules and Regulations.

Both Senate and House of Representatives recommended that the ERC implement Resolution No. 20 Series of 2017 because it already addressed the intent of the proposed legislative measure</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><b>ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>REFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY ON 2018-08-08</td></tr></table>
