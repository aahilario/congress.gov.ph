1.	There is an overlap in the functions of the proposed Social Enterprise Development Council (SEDC) with the existing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development (MSMED) Council provided for in the Magna Carta for MSMEs.

Chair Unabia and Rep. Fortun concurred to expand the membership and functions of the MSMED Council to cover SEs.

2.	The Bureau of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development (BMSMED) can serve as the Secretariat of the expanded MSMED Council, which Asst. Dir. Alicia Opena said BMSMED can take on. Ms. Aurora Villaviray of the DOF pointed out that the DBM can give additional plantilla positions to BMSMED for that purpose.
3.	The special credit windows and allocation of credit resources to SEs can also be addressed by the Magna Carta for MSMEs.
4.	The fiduciary obligations of the SSS and GSIS prevent them from participating in the SE Guarantee Fund Pool (SEGFP).
5.	Atty. Rodrigo Silverio, Jr., Legal Counsel of PAGCOR, suggested that the proposed contribution of PAGCOR to the SE Development Fund (SEDP) and the SEGFP can be taken from the 50% share of the National Government in the earnings of PAGCOR.
6.	There must be a clear cut definition of an SE to include the percentage of the earnings that must be re-invested in the country by an SE with foreign ownership.
7.	Rep. Ruwel Peter S. Gonzaga opined that the bill should have a provision to prevent a repeat of the QUEDANCOR experience which saw uncollaterized loans get unpaid leading to the agency’s bankruptcy.

The Committee approved that all Members present be made co-authors of the SE Bill.

Chairman Unabia directed the Secretariat to:

1.	Include a provision in the SE bill to prevent a repeat of the QUEDANCOR experience.
2.	Invite and get the comments of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).
3.	Invite and get the comments of the officers of the MSMED Council.

The Committee deferred further deliberations on the SE Bills, pending the submission of the position papers of the PNOC and the other agencies which have not complied yet.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2.
