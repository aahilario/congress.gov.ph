Deliberated upon by the Mother Committee on 2017-05-09</b><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-Committee Chairman Peter Unabia stated that House Bill No. 5158 or the Pondo sa Pagbabago at Pag-asenso Bill (P3 bill) aims to replace the 5-6  money lending scheme and to make available a micro lending facility with an interest rate lower than the prevailing market rate.  If enacted into law, it will ensure the continuity of the P3 Program being implemented by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) through the Small Business Corporation (SB Corp.).
	In his sponsorship remarks, Rep. Gil Acosta cited the difficulty of the MSMEs  to access the credit programs for MSMEs due to high interest rate, and voluminous and stringent requirements, which is why they resort to borrowing from the “5-6” micro lending scheme.   
	Mr. Melvin Abanto, Senior Vice President of the SB Corp., informed the Committee that the P3 Program was rolled out in three pilot areas, namely,  Mindoro, Sarangani and Tacloban.  The Committee requested the DTI to submit a status report on the roll-out in the three pilot provinces, and the guidelines for the P3 Program.

	Dir. Jerry Clavesillas of the Bureau of Micro, Small, Medium Enterprise Development  (BMSMED) of the DTI stated that other countries have a budget allocation for microfinancing. He emphasized that through the P3 Act, micro lending will be institutionalized and it will be mandatory for the government to lend out to the micro enterprise sector. Ms. Pia Bernandette Roman-Tayag of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) informed the body that microfinancing has long been promoted by the BSP and that 168 banks are engaged therein.

	The representatives from the DTI, BSP, Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP), Chamber of Thrift Bank (CTB) and Microfinance Council of the Philippines, Inc. (MCPI) expressed their support for the passage of the measure. 

	Among the other comments and suggestions given by the resource persons are:  (a) need to strengthen the guarantee facility because of the risk of lending to micro enterprises;  and (b) perception that loans to micro enterprises are dole-outs, accounting for the low repayment rate.
	Rep. Angelina Tan suggested that the P3 loans be given to the poorest populations, instead of the poorest provinces. 
	The Committee agreed to convene a technical working group, to be chaired by Rep. Tan, to fine-tune the provisions of the bill.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-There being no objection, said Section 4 now reads as follows:

“Section 4. Establishment of Entrepreneurial Training Programs. – All government offices and agencies shall prepare and implement a post-service Government Service Entrepreneurship Development Program (GSEDP) for their employees based on guidelines prescribed by the Civil Service Commission (CSC). The GSEDP shall be designed in such a manner as to help employees learn what they need to know to develop ideas and actualize them into successful businesses and how to increase entrepreneurial opportunities in their respective municipalities, provinces and regions. The GSEDP shall introduce employees to technology transfer systems, entrepreneurial educational programs, entrepreneurial networks, financial literacy and livelihood trainings/seminars, as part of the agency’s annual training plan.

“Intensive preparation activities and learning modules for retirees shall start five (5) years prior to their retirement date. The post-service assistance may be given on a consultancy basis to strengthen the proposed programs to be implemented under this Act.

“Each agency shall have full-time, in-house business tutors and counsellors on the implementation of the proposed programs for retiring employees. The regular funding for the program shall be taken from the agency’s annual budget.”

In Section 5, Rep. Noel opted to delete the last portion of Section 5 regarding the preferential rights of government employees’ cooperatives to operate revenue-generating activities in available government-owned sites and facilities, said Section 5 to now read, as follows:

“Section 5.   Establishment of Cooperatives and Savings and Loan Associations. – All government agencies shall promote and support the establishment of cooperatives with the assistance of the Cooperative Development Authority (CDA) and of savings and loans associations, by recognizing, protecting and upholding the rights of employees to organize cooperatives and savings and loan associations in their respective offices to generate financial resources and develop employees’ entrepreneurial skills. Existing cooperatives and savings and loans associations in government agencies shall incorporate the development of employees’ entrepreneurial skills as part of their objective. Cooperatives and savings and loan associations shall be encouraged to retain the membership of employees even after retirement from public service.”

After deliberating on Section 6, the TWG agreed to add a proviso therein, to now read as follows:

“SEC. 6. Networking with Government Financial Institutions.  - The heads of all government agencies, including government-owned and controlled corporations concerned, shall coordinate with existing government financial institutions (GFIs) to provide sources of financing for the viable income-generating entrepreneurial projects of their retired employees, subject to the mandate of the GFI concerned. Experts from the GFIs shall be called upon to conduct lectures, workshops in capacity building for entrepreneurship skills and live case studies of successful entrepreneurs. Participants shall be taught to identify and evaluate opportunities for new ventures and to understand how the capital investment process works. All GFIs shall set aside funds for this purpose: Provided, That financing of the entrepreneurial projects of retired government employees shall be dependent on the strength and quality of the proposed enterprise’s project and business cash flows, overall credit worthiness and other mitigating measures, in accordance with safe and sound banking practices, where applicable.”

The TWG likewise  agreed to adopt the recommendation of LBP on Section 7 for the CSC to spearhead the coordination among government agencies for the preparation, implementation and monitoring of a comprehensive plan for the government employees entrepreneurial development, as well as its funding sources, instead of creating a Council as provided for in the bill.  

Furthermore, Rep. Noel enjoined each agency to prepare and submit to the CSC a comprehensive plan to develop entrepreneurial capabilities, managerial expertise and technical skills and also to monitor the implementation of the program.  The CSC was requested to submit the agency’s confirmation on the afore-stated role of the CSC the following week.

Inputs were also made by the TWG in Sections 7, 8 and 9, which now read, to wit:

“SEC. 7. Monitoring of the Government Employees’Entrepreneurship Development Program. – The Civil Service Commission (CSC) shall spearhead the coordination among all agencies and the four public sector unions in the preparation, implementation and monitoring of a comprehensive plan for the government employees’ entrepreneurial development, including funding sources.

“Each agency shall be tasked to prepare and submit to the CSC a comprehensive plan to develop entrepreneurial capabilities, managerial expertise, financial planning and technical skills, and fund sources.

“SEC. 8. Post-service Assistance. – All government agencies shall extend post-service assistance to their respective retirees and shall include this as part of their human resources development plan. They shall develop a post-service assistance program to backstop aspiring entrepreneurs in the development and implementation of their ideas. The program shall cover the entire gamut of the venture creation process from idea generation to building viable business, with emphasis on the nurturing roles of the GFIs, and highlighting successful entrepreneurs as models. The assistance shall include follow-up programs after the business has been set-up, in order to ensure the profitability and sustainability of the business.

“SEC. 9. Implementing Rules and Regulations. – The CSC shall promulgate the rules and regulations needed to implement the provisions of this Act within sixty (60) days after it effectivity.”
