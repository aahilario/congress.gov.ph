Belaro,...paid homage to the teachers 
whom he described as the unsung heroes for their contributions to nation-building. He stated that through legislation, he wished to give the teachers more time for themselves, for their families as well as their other concerns.  
Pointing out that the teaching profession is not 
only about pedagogy but also involves myriad tasks, he said that he is proposing to look at the problem of low salaries of teachers in a different light considering that it is not just about their salaries but also about the terms and conditions of their work. As such, he then proposed that teachers be allowed to work for half-day only and appealed to his colleagues to support his
