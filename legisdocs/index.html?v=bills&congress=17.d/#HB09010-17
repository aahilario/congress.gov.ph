and municipalities are paid less than their national counterparts which seems to stem from 
legislations such as R.A.No.6727 or the Wage Rationalization Act (1989); or R.A.No.6758 
or the Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989; or R.A.No.7160 or the Local
Government Code, Book I Title III Sec. 81 and Book 2 Title V Chapter III Art.1 Sec.325.    

Aims to rectify the injustice by restoring the uniform implementation of the national salary 
schedule (under the Salary Standardization Law) for public sector employees throughout the 
country by repealing Sec.10 of E.O.No.201 s.2016 and by amending Sec.81 of R.A.No.7160.
