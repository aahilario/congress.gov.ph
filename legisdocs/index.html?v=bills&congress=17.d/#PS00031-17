Aglipay-Villar talked about the importance
of and misconceptions about breastfeeding as she
noted that August is being celebrated as the National Breastfeeding Month and the previous week was World Breastfeeding Week. Citing her personal experiences as a breastfeeding mother, she explained how breastfeeding was a personal choice but was not a moral issue nor an issue only about women; and cited the lack of facilities for and public knowledge and awareness about breastfeeding. After presenting studies and facts and figures, she stressed that breastfeeding
is a public health issue of national significance
that would address not only malnutrition, disease,
and mortality in the women’s and children’s
sectors but hunger, poverty, and economic growth
and equality in the country and society as a whole. The Lady Legislator then asked the Members to prioritize bills that she had filed on infant feeding, a maternal health program, and a 100-day maternity leave; and to promote breastfeeding through various modes of media.
