Bordado disclosed how this year’s Marian festival had to contend with the shadow of terrorism.  
He thereafter cited a PNP intelligence report that a member of the Abu Sayyaf Group was in Naga City, but that the Joint Operations Center led by the City Government of Naga and the Archdiocese of Caceres, together with the AFP, the PNP as well as other concerned government and NGOs had reassured the public that everything was under control and that proactive steps were being taken to address the threat of terrorism. Thus, the nineday Peñafrancia festivities successfully proceeded without any terroristic act, he added. He expressed belief that the Joint Operations Center was worth replicating in other areas of the country and said that with the outpouring of faith, hope and love, the Peñafrancia festival will always be a source of strength and inspiration for people in quest of peace for a strife-torn world.
