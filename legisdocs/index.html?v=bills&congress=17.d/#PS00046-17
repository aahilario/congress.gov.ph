De Jesus assailed in Filipino the poor
cellphone services as well as the penalties and hidden fees charged by telecommunications companies (telcos) to the consumers, she related her personal experience of customer service troubles as a postpaid subscriber who had used the same cellphone number in the last 13 years and had recently applied for an upgrade of her postpaid plan. She recalled the difficulties she encountered because 1) she had to wait long as her transaction had to pass through customer service representatives in a call center; 2) she was charged for a decade-long bill that was never reflected in her statement of account so she
was forced to stop the subscription for the particular cellphone number; 3) her application for a new postpaid plan was cut because she was told that she had to settle first her old account; 4) she suffered from a daylong disconnection that she had to personally talk to the OIC manager and put in writing her complaint. . .
