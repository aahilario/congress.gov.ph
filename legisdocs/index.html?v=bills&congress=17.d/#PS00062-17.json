Rep. Shernee Abubakar Tan rose on a question of privilege to condemn an attempt to open her vehicle in the HOR North Wing parking lot the \r\nprevious day. She said that the PNP...surmised that the culprit had intended to plant explosives under the front seat where she usually sat. She stressed the need to strictly implement security \r\nmeasures in the HOR premises ...;stated that the country has been jittery since the recent Davao City bombing and the ongoing intense military operations against the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) and that they cannot count out the possibility that the mastermind in the previous night\u2019s incident would ride on the Abu Sayyaf fever and point out the latter as the perpetrators. She then called for a thorough investigation of the incident and issued a warning to those who had intended to harm her that they would not succeed in silencing her voice as the Representative of Party-List \r\nKusug Tausug.(SOURCE: House Jounal No.19,p.7)\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003ETAN, SHERNEE ABUBAKAR\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: LOCAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON RULES ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
