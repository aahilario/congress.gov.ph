Bordado thanked President Rodrigo\r\nRoa Duterte for declaring August 18, 2016 as a special nonworking day in Naga City to commemorate the 4th death anniversary of former City Mayor and Secretary of the Interior and Local Government Jesse M. Robredo. Rep. Bordado pointed out that Mayor Jesse Manalastas Robredo, the first Philippine mayor who had been conferred the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award (the Asian counterpart of the Nobel Prize), transformed Naga City and laid the groundwork for people\u2019s participation therein. He said that the latter\r\nformulated the Good Governance Model which consisted of a progressive perspective, functional partnerships, and people\u2019s participation; prioritized growth with equity; and established and encouraged partnerships with various public and private sectors. In summing up his speech, Rep. Bordado held that Mayor Robredo\u2019s legacy of people\u2019s participation in local governance was secure not only in his city but in the entire country; and remarked that the mayor did not even have to be buried in the Libingan ng Mga Bayani. MANIFESTATION OF REP. BELARO\r\nOn behalf of his fellow-educators and fellow-Bicolanos, Rep. Belaro congratulated Rep. Bordado for his passionate and timely speech on Mayor Robredo whom he called a genuine hero.\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.10,pp.21-22) \r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EBORDADO, GABRIEL H.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-15\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREMARKS:&nbspManifestation by Rep.
