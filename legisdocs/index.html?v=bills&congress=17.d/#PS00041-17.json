Vergara initially said that corruption, which\r\nshe defined as abuse of power for private gain, was pervasive, systemic, and prevalent in the country. She then said that because of countless instances of shooting and murder of barangay officials in her district and the inaction thereon by Nueva Ecija Governor Aurelio Umali and his wife, Representative Cherry Umali, she ran under the platform of change and progress against the influential and well connected couple who used to be a political ally and ruled over the province for the last 15 years. She stressed that she wanted to protect the weakest members of the political chain and will file and support measures that will entitle barangay officials to insurance coverage and pension under the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). She subsequently alleged that several officials of the Bureau of Immigration, whom she named, had conspired and tampered with official government documents to support several disqualification cases filed against her in order to benefit the Umalis and help them remain in power. She stressed that Congress must pass a law providing more severe punishment for corrupt public servants. She maintained that the country must be ruled by laws and not connections and must treat all Filipinos with equal respect and courtesy regardless of social, economic, and educational stature. \r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.11,pp.14-15)\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EVERGARA, ROSANNA &quot;RIA&quot; V.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-16\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ORDER AND SAFETY ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
