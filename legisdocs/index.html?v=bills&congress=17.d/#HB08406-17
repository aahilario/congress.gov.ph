No. 8371) because our IPs continually remain among the poor and marginalized sectors of our society; basic services remain deficient in geographically isolated and extreme areas (GIDAs); and reports of serious violations of their rights, their displacement from the ancestral lands, the environmental degradation, and cultural teardown still abound.

Provides that resource centers for IPs shall be ethnographically located, gender and rights based, and shall constitute service areas as Statistical Service Area, Human Development Index Service Area and Domains Management Service Area.
