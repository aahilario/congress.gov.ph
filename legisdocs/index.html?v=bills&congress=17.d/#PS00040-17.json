Bondoc, there being no\r\nobjection, the Chair recognized Rep. Raul V. Del Mar from the First District of Cebu City who questioned the withdrawal of Cebu City Mayor Tommy Osme\u00f1a\u2019s deputation as a representative of the National Police Commission (Napolcom). After adverting to Republic Act No. 8551 which provides for the automatic deputation of governors and mayors as Napolcom agents and the grounds for the withdrawal of the same, he cited Napolcom Resolution No. 2016-467 enumerating Mayor Osme\u00f1a\u2019s actions that were considered inimical to national security and the President\u2019s peace and order campaign. He thereafter relayed one by one the City of Cebu\u2019s refuting the allegations,\r\ninitially stating that what was stopped was not\r\nthe police officers\u2019 allowances but their cash rewards that came from the mayor\u2019s personal funds.\r\nAs he clarified Cebu City\u2019s budgetary support to\r\nthe local police units, Rep. Del Mar stated that the Napolcom was grossly misinformed that Cebu City Mayor Osme\u00f1a was guilty of engaging in acts inimical to national security or which negate the effectiveness of the peace and order campaign. He also stated that neither he nor Rep. Rodrigo A. Abellanosa of the Second District of Cebu City was consulted by the Napolcom with regard to the withdrawal of Mayor Osme\u00f1a\u2019s deputation. As such, he requested the House Committee on Local Government to investigate the legality and propriety of the Napolcom\u2019s withdrawal of deputation of Mayor Osme\u00f1a. INTERPELLATION\r\nOF REP. ABELLANOSA Reps. Abellanosa and Del Mar discussed the matter of the reward money given by Cebu City Mayor Osme\u00f1a and the pullout of his police escorts. They also delved into Cebu City\u2019s budgetary support to the local police units which may have been the reason for the Napolcom\u2019s resolution withdrawing Mayor Osme\u00f1a\u2019s deputation as his actions were considered inimical to national security and the govenrment\u2019s peace and order campaign. INTERPELLATION OF REP. ATIENZA\r\nReps. Atienza and Del Mar exchanged views on\r\nthe Napolcom\u2019s stripping of Cebu City Mayor Osme\u00f1a\u2019s police control; agreed that the principle of local autonomy allowing police control is enshrined in the Constitution and vital in the achievement of peace and order as now being pursued by President Duterte; supported Rep. Del Mar\u2019s call for a congressional inquiry into the Napolcom as well as a review of the PNP Law; and expressed support to Mayor Osmena\u2019s fight for his right to police control. Rep. Atienza then congratulated and reiterated his support to Rep. Del Mar and urged Congress to adhere to the intentions of the Constitution by respecting the\r\nautonomy of the LGUs in allowing mayors full control and supervision of their local police force.\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.10,pp.22-23)\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EDEL MAR, RAUL V.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-15\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREMARKS:&nbspInterpellation by Reps.
