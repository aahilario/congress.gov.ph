Tambunting cited the importance of the\r\nfreedom of information by highlighting the following points: it is the very essence of democracy; it enables the people to participate in the decision-making process of government; it allows them to monitor and check any abuses of power or wrongdoing by leaders whom they have elected in office; and it helps the people prevent government officials from committing the wrongdoings at the expense and detriment of\r\nthe people they vowed to serve. He pointed out that freedom of information is so important that it has been enshrined in the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions both of which recognize the right of access of the people to matters of public concern and guarantee the right of the people to access official records, documents, papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, decisions and research data used as basis for policy development. Although there were laws passed to\r\nmake available information needed by the public or\r\nthe courts, he disclosed that these laws had not been effective in curbing the commission of anomalous transactions in government. It is for this reason, he said, that he had filed the Freedom of Information Bill in the 16th Congress but he lamented that the Members failed to pass it on time maybe for more urgent and pressing reasons. He then informed the Body that on June 30, 2016, he had reintroduced House Bill No. 126 or the Freedom of Information Bill which would help President Rodrigo Roa Duterte achieve his goal of alleviating if not eradicating poverty in the country by attracting international and local investments in the country. He expressed hope that the Members, through further debates, deliberations and requisite public hearings, would come out with a law that includes all essential elements of a genuine Freedom of Information Law. Considering that the President announced during his SONA that he had signed and issued an executive order requiring public disclosure\r\nof documents related to government transactions,\r\nassets, liabilities and net worth of government officials, and other documents to media and the public, subject to certain conditions such as national security and others, he said that the President needs the help and support of the Legislative and the Judicial branches of government. It is in this light that he would seek the support of the Members in passing\r\nHouse Bill No. 126 the soonest possible time. \r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.6,p.29)\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003ETAMBUNTING, GUS S.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-03\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC INFORMATION ON 2016-08-03\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
