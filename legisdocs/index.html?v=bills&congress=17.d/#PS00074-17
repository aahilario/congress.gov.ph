Nograles dwelled on the alleged web of lies
claimed by the surprise witness in the hearing on extrajudicial killings of the Senate Committee on Justice. He said that he and his father, former Speaker Prospero Nograles, have come out to dispute the lies told by the surprise witness,. . .  Rep. Nograles also lamented the inconsistencies and distortions of facts and events which have been overlooked; and the surprise witness being heard in a legislative hearing upon the direct endorsement of the
committee chairperson herself. In this light, Rep.
Nograles pointed out that the Senate hearing was not a sincere search for truth on the matter of extrajudicial killings but a calculated and unmitigated direct assault on the dignity and reputation of the President of the Republic. . . He added that at stake is not simply the success on the war against illegal drugs or the agenda for reform of the Duterte Administration
but the stability and survival of the Republic.
In conclusion, Rep. Nograles condemned the lies
to destroy the President’s dignity and reputation and the use of inquiries in aid of legislation for such and asked the Body to be vigilant in defending the truth, justice, and the people’s mandate. (SOURCE: House Journal No.23,p.6)
