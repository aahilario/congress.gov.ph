Brosas spoke on\r\nthe issue of lowering the age of criminal responsibility wherein she discussed the economic aspect and social behavior of youth offenders. As she cited the position of the Psychological Association of the Philippines, the SalinLahi Alliance for Children\u2019s Concern, and the Philippine Action for Youth Offenders, she\r\npointed out that lowering the age of criminal responsibility to nine years old has no basis and would be making the situation worse and would create a far bleaker and darker future for the generations to come. She stressed that youth offenders should be looked at as victims and not as criminals. As such and as the Philippines is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Rep. Brosas enjoined her colleagues to probe into the implementation of the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act and to help strengthen the government\u2019s capacity to respond to the problem of youth offenders by establishing\r\nmore halfway homes and empowering social\r\nworkers on the ground before putting the blame on the children themselves. \r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.5,pp.50-51)\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EBROSAS, ARLENE D.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-02\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
