Zarate delved into the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) which Bayan Muna
and other nationalist organizations have wanted to be scrapped. He said that EDCA is not good for the country because this would only open the Philippines to America for their use in any way they wish. He further said that EDCA will give American troops the power to stay permanently on the agreed locations on rotational basis. This, he averred, would just bring back the American bases to the country which the Filipinos had fought for to be ousted. Rep. Zarate pointed out that the nullification of EDCA will be a big challenge for President Duterte’s Administration who had said earlier on that he would only recognize treaties in accordance with the people’s welfare.
