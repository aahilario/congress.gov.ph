Villarin...spoke on the challenge of addressing the concern of millions of informal settlers in Metro Manila, as well as in other highly urbanized parts of the country...; mentioned several problems related to urbanization and informal settlements, including among others, the increase in the number of informal settlers in recent years, the supposed housing backlog for informal settler families, and the ineffectiveness of the national government\u2019s effort in focusing on off-city housing projects. As Vice President Leni Robredo has declared the suspension of off-city resettlement programs while President Duterte has announced a \u201cno eviction, no demolition without resettlement\u201d policy, Rep. Villarin asked where the government would get the funds if they would focus on in-city housing projects considering that the NHA funds have already been used up \r\nfor off-city relocation projects...In conclusion, Rep. Villarin said that Congress can push for policies on the building of disaster-resilient \r\nsettlements for urban communities; institutionalization of the DILG\u2019s role in the implementation of the Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992 and relevant laws; funding for a socialized housing finance corporation; and provision of  additional allocations for the ISF resettlement fund.
