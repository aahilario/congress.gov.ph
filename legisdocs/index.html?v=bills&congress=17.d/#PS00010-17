Teves spoke about the rehabilitation of the
country’s drug surrenderees, and citing his previous experience as a recovering drug addict, suggested ways of minimizing national government’s cost of drug rehabilitation from P90,000 per addict per program to only P2,500. He said that this could be achieved by doing the programs in public classrooms manned by counselors and volunteers from five o’clock in the afternoon to eight o’clock in the evening as by then, the facilities are no longer used by the
students; allowing 50 drug dependents per classroom for a period of eight to 12 weeks, with follow-up meetings every eight to nine in the morning in the barangays’ covered courts; and providing nine to 10 optional physical therapy activities. Rep. Teves disclosed that he, together with Rep. Albee Benitez, Governor Alfredo Marañon of Negros Occidental, and his brother, former Rep. Pryde Henry A. Teves would soon launch said program in his province. He also discussed the reasons why the Members should consider his proposed modality and be wary of “chopsuey” or mixed modalities as there are various types of drug pushers and users. In closing, he informed the people and those concerned that drug
addiction is a disease and therefore should be covered by the PhilHealth.
