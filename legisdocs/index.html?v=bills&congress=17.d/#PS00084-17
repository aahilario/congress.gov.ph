Jalosjos rose to expose anew certain personalities in his province which he alleged are involved in the illegal drug trade...lamented however that the illegal drug trade in his province still continues because it is protected by certain police officials and narco-politicians.  
He then presented to the Body a drug matrix identifying the names of the drug lord inmates in the Dipolog City Jail, the drug protectors, the drug operations and activities, and the money trail. He stated that these drug lords are under the protection of SPO2 Roy P. Vertudes who directly coordinates with operators and handlers of the illegal drug trade. He then explained why SPO2 Vertrudes has remained “untouchable” in his province ... He disclosed that in one murder case filed against SPO2 Vertudes in 2015, then Justice Sec. Leila de Lima intervened in his behalf by issuing a department order. With respect to reports that the Dipolog City Port is being used for illegal drugs operations, Rep. Jalosjos said that there is already an existing port in Dapitan City which is only a stone’s throw away from the former. He asked why the Dipolog City Port was created,  and why it was being run by a LGU that was not authorized by the PPA and not under the jurisdiction of the Phil. Coast Guard Auxiliary... He said that he was  also a victim of an assassination plot during the campaign period and lamented that the PNP has not acted on his case, this as he opined that SPO2 Vertudes and his 
cohorts have remained untouched because of their 
protector, and asked for their immediate investigation...he asked for the replacement of the PNP Provincial Director, NBI Provincial Director and PDEA Provincial Chief assigned in his province. He also recommended the investigation of and filing of charges against the DILG and DOJ officials in the previous Administration because of gross neglect of duty and giving of undue favors.(SOURCE: House Journal No.25,pp.11-12)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>PRINCIPAL AUTHOR/S : <b>JALOSJOS, SETH FREDERICK P.</b></td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>DATE FILED : 2016-09-21</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>SIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>NATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour</td></tr><tr><td colspan=3>REMARKS:&nbspInterpellation by Rep.
