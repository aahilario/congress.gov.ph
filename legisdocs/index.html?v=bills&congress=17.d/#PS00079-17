Rep. Carlos Isagani T. Zarate... spoke in 
Filipino to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the removal of US military bases in Subic and 
Clark through the so-called “Magnificent 12 Senators” and at the same time, to point out that America’s domination over the Philippines has continued through the operation of the VFA) and the EDCA, as well as the existence of neoliberal policies that disproportionately favor the US causing damage to the national economy and the Filipino citizens. Rep. Zarate however believed that hope remains for the patriotic Filipinos in light of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s statements in the past few days on the dismissal of US military troops in Mindanao; in exposing the massacre by US military troops of Moros in Bud Dajo and the Samareños in Balangiga; and his 
rejection of a joint patrol in the West Philippines Sea. He maintained that the President’s statements and proposals for an independent foreign policy will surely benefit the country and its people. Thereafter, Rep. Zarate stated that the present Administration should push for the country’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in accordance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and that an independent foreign policy to succeed requires 
the collective action of the citizenry, a strong political will, and an aggressive rejection of neocolonialism and US domination.
