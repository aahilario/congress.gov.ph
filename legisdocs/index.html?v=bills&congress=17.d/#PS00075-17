Roman initially recalled the support and acceptance that her father, the late Rep. Antonino P. Roman, had given her as a daughter, transgender, and politician. She also thanked the Members of the 17th Congress for welcoming her and treating her with dignity and respect, as had been her fatherâ€™s dream. Rep. Roman then advocated the needs of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders (LGBTs), saying she could not turn her back on their plight even as she wanted to focus on serving her constituents as her parents had done before her. She said that the LGBTs had suffered discrimination and had been denied adequate legal protection as she had herself experienced although they were part of society and were human beings; and enumerated their needs such as sociopsychological support and legal and labor protection. Stressing that Congress must immediately pass the Anti-Discrimination Bill, she discussed some features
thereof such as discriminatory acts on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI) and the corresponding penalties. . .
