Bondoc,
Rep. Salvador B. Belaro Jr. from Party-List 1-
Ang Edukasyon focused on President Duterte’s recent statement that the party-list system has been abused and has become a mockery of the law. He noted that said comment was followed by ascerbic bashings of the system in Facebook and social media that prompted supporters of his party-list group to issue a statement in defense of its members. He added that on behalf of 1-Ang Edukasyon Party-List, he took exception to the President’s opinion and stressed that his
party-list group’s presence in Congress is not a mockery of the law. This, as he underscored the following points: 1) around 278,693 Filipinos voted for his party-list organization because they believe in its intention and platform in the field of education; 2) the party-list system is an equalizing measure and a legal innovation in sync with the democratization of power and promotion of social justice; 3) his group’s nominees
in the last party-list elections were self-made persons who are pillars of the education sector; and 4) he had filed 30 bills and resolutions fostering, empowering, and protecting education, among others. He then urged his fellow party-list Representatives to respond accordingly to what he referred to as “a crisis in the image of the party-list system in general,” by 1) educating the public on the importance of the system, 2) showcasing its accomplishments thus far; and 3) raising the bar of what previous party-list
groups in Congress have done.
