Garcia first related how the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) was transformed into a world-renowned and world-class facility and became a source of pride, inspiration, and hope for rehabilitation and redemption of inmates thereof and for the country in general during her nineyear term as Cebu governor.  Subsequently, she lamented how it disintegrated since Governor Hilario Davide III assumed office in 2013 and recounted the
recent raids that yielded millions in cash money, 
illegal drugs, gadgets and appliances, weapons, and drug paraphernalia among the inmates and jail guards within and outside of the centerâ€™s premises...;stressed that Governor Davide must be made to answer the issues and not skirt the matter by suggesting the transfer of the CPDRC management to the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology 
(BJMP). She reminded Governor Davide that as the 
provincial governor, he is the keeper of the provincial jail as provided for in Section 1731, Article III of the Revised Administrative Code of 1917 and Section 468, Article III of the 1991 Local Government Code (LGC)...;informed the Body that she would file a resolution calling for an investigation, in aid of legislation, into the glaring deficiencies and gross mismanagement and administration of the CPDRC.
