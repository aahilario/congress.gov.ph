Zarate delved into the Enhanced Defense\r\nCooperation Agreement (EDCA) which Bayan Muna\r\nand other nationalist organizations have wanted to be scrapped. He said that EDCA is not good for the country because this would only open the Philippines to America for their use in any way they wish. He further said that EDCA will give American troops the power to stay permanently on the agreed locations on rotational basis. This, he averred, would just bring back the American bases to the country which the Filipinos had fought for to be ousted. Rep. Zarate pointed out that the nullification of EDCA will be a big challenge for President Duterte\u2019s Administration who had said earlier on that he would only recognize treaties in accordance with the people\u2019s welfare. \r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.5,p.49)\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EZARATE, CARLOS ISAGANI T.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2016-08-02\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ENATURE : Speech-Privilege Hour\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SECURITY ON 2016-09-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
