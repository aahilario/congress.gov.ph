Aglipay-Villar, in joining President Duterte
in his fight to end contractualization schemes that rob workers of their rights promised them under the Constitution and under the Labor Code, said that she will continue the fight against rampant exploitative contractualization schemes that undermine the dignity of workers. At the start of her first term as the Representative
of DIWA Party-List, she stated that she made the end of labor contractualization as her priority because it was being used to circumvent the workerâ€™s constitutionally enshrined right to security of tenure. She added that the bill she filed in the 15th and the 16th Congress to correct the loopholes in the Labor Code to end such constitutional practice, was approved only up to the Committee level and that she would re-file it in the present Congress. After citing the fact that more than one-third of the labor force are not regular employees, Rep. Aglipay discussed the three forms of exploitative contractualization
that demand redress, namely, labor only
contracting, fixed-term employment, and the
abuse of the probationary status of workers. She proposed to change the legal framework for employment by adopting several measures such as limiting fixed term contracts or automatic termination and invalidating the termination of probationary employees when done to prevent security of tenure. She explained, however, that she did not intend to do away with fixed-term employment or job contracting but only to clarify which jobs may be legitimately contracted out
and which ones should be done by regular workers.
To conclude, Rep. Aglipay asked her colleagues
to work for the plight of the labor force because securing their jobs is securing the future of the nation.
