Acharon underlined the significance of the \r\nDuterte government\u2019s campaign against lawless violence and terrorism in the country and highlighted the role of LGUs in the overall \r\nscheme of preserving peace and order as well as guaranteeing public safety. As the spate of bombings in Mindanao may appear to be isolated cases, he stated however that these violent acts are continuous and the magnitude of violence and damages to lives and property are proportionate to the prevailing crisis at hand. As he cited several acts of terrorism in Mindanao... Rep. Acharon stressed that a sustainable campaign for a more exceptional level of public order and safety needs the proactive cooperation of every Filipino citizen as well as the support of LGUs...; pointed out that R.A. No.6975 or the DILG Act of 1990 clearly established the policy ... As he fully supports the ongoing war on drugs and campaign against lawlessness, Rep. Acharon stated that the government must also address the acts of terrorism that is continuously being carried out with impunity...
