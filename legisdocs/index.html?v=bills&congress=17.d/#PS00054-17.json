Bordado discussed the importance of the national budget especially the budgetary\r\nallocation to the different government agencies for the delivery of basic services to the people;  stressed that ..., there is a need to examine\r\nthe absorptive capacities of all departments, assess the regional allocation of public investments, and review whether the allocation of resources has been done in a manner that no department or agency receives more resources at the expense of another; expressed concern on the budgetary cuts in the 2017 proposed budgets of the Departments of Health (DOH), and Agriculture (DA) ...; affirmed that the government must vigorously pursue the strategy of allocating resources to local government units (LGUs)...; urged Congress to ... to immediately craft the Budget Reform Act with the assistance of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).
