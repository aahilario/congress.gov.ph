Yap centered on the defectively designed insurance for agricultural products with the agricultural crop insurance continuing to be peril- or indemnitybased. He said that the inefficiency, tediousness, complexity and attendant hazards in crop insurance which\r\nresult in exorbitant and unreasonable premium prices for insurance products make crop insurance in the country very unpopular. However, Rep. Yap pointed out that in other parts of the world such as India, the Carribean and Africa, which are also reeling from the effects of climate change, crop insurance is being offered on the basis of innovative terms, thus, instead of being peril- or indemnity-based, crop insurance in these areas is classified as weather index-based insurance\r\n(WIBI). . . In closing, Rep. Yap sought his colleagues\u2019 support for the recapitalization and expansion of the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation\u2019s mandate to engage in reinsurance and direct insurance of WIBI products for crops and agriculture.
