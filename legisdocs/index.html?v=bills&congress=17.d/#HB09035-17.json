It deepens the potential\r\nof literacy education to critically analyze relationships between media and audiences, information, \r\nand power. Along with this mainstream analysis, alternative media production empowers students to \r\ncreate their own messages that can challenge media texts and narratives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeks to create a critical media literacy curriculum not only of high school students but even primary\/elementary students to help in cultivating a more informed and well-educated public to combat the surge of false information in the wake of technological advancements and in developing critical thinking skills at a very young age.\r\n\r\nProvides that all programs to be implemented and curriculum to be developed shall duly promote and safeguard the fundamental freedom of speech and expression, and shall be guided by the principles of critical media literacy education summarized as: a) Media is a COMPETENT TOOL; b) Media is EVOLVING; c) Media is produce in DIFFERENT MODES; and d) Media DOES NOT EXIST IN A VACCUUM.\r\n\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003EELAGO, SARAH JANE I.\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EDATE FILED : 2019-02-06\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003ESIGNIFICANCE: NATIONAL\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003E\u003Cb\u003EACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES\u003C\/b\u003E\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EREFERRAL TO THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION ON 2019-02-07\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003C\/table\u003E"}
