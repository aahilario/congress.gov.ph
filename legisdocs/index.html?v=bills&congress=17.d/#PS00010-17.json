Teves spoke about the rehabilitation of the\r\ncountry\u2019s drug surrenderees, and citing his previous experience as a recovering drug addict, suggested ways of minimizing national government\u2019s cost of drug rehabilitation from P90,000 per addict per program to only P2,500. He said that this could be achieved by doing the programs in public classrooms manned by counselors and volunteers from five o\u2019clock in the afternoon to eight o\u2019clock in the evening as by then, the facilities are no longer used by the\r\nstudents; allowing 50 drug dependents per classroom for a period of eight to 12 weeks, with follow-up meetings every eight to nine in the morning in the barangays\u2019 covered courts; and providing nine to 10 optional physical therapy activities. Rep. Teves disclosed that he, together with Rep. Albee Benitez, Governor Alfredo Mara\u00f1on of Negros Occidental, and his brother, former Rep. Pryde Henry A. Teves would soon launch said program in his province. He also discussed the reasons why the Members should consider his proposed modality and be wary of \u201cchopsuey\u201d or mixed modalities as there are various types of drug pushers and users. In closing, he informed the people and those concerned that drug\r\naddiction is a disease and therefore should be covered by the PhilHealth.\r\n(SOURCE: House Journal No.4,pp.72&73)\r\n\u003C\/td\u003E\u003C\/tr\u003E\u003Ctr\u003E\u003Ctd colspan=3\u003EPRINCIPAL AUTHOR\/S : \u003Cb\u003ETEVES, ARNOLFO JR.
