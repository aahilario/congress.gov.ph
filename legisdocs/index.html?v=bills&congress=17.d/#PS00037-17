presentation about his topic, Rep. Teves spoke about an ongoing quarrying operation in his province, and sought clarification who between the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Gina Lopez and the incumbent provincial governor has jurisdiction over the matter and should be made answerable to the people; whether the operation should be considered as small or large scale quarrying/mining; and whether the provincial governor should be sanctioned for granting a permit to operate even in the absence of benching. He expressed hope
that the Duterte Administration would act on the matter at the soonest possible time.
INTERPELLATION OF REP. LIMKAICHONG. Recognized by the Chair, Rep. Jocelyn Sy Limkaichong at the outset said that she shares the sentiments of Rep. Teves considering that she is also from the province of Negros Oriental. On successive queries of Rep. Limkaichong, Rep. Teves said that the pictures he had presented would already speak for themselves. He also requested the DENR to check whether the export and recorded volumes were properly recorded by the mining company. He disclosed that years back, the DENR had said that
it was not under their jurisdiction but it was the prerogative of the governor to issue mining permits. Considering that Rep. Teves has no data to substantiate his claim, Rep. Limkaichong moved that the latterâ€™s verbatim speech and its accompanying pictures be forwarded to DENR Secretary Lopez for further investigation.
