He also alleged that the governor was using said police director to operate his money-making\r\nschemes...; called for an investigation into the illegal activities in his province and requested\r\nPNP Regional Dir.Conrad Capa to immediately relieve police Provincial Dir. Nestor Tiempo from his post as the mandate of the police is to protect the people and not to be a partisan to a provincial governor.
