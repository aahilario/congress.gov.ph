Gabriela stressed that the state of women reflects the true state of a nation. Speaking in Filipino, she discussed the plight of this sector which includes issues of low wages, demolition, and lack of job opportunities and basic services in relocation centers. She reminded the Members about President Duterte’s pronouncements regarding the uplifting of the people’s welfare as she informed them of a women’s summit that was recently held in Davao that came up with a comprehensive agenda summed up in the word “CHANGE”. She then explained what each letter of the word “Change” stood for and stressed the mandate of her Party-List which is for the advancement of women and that they would fight any abuse against them. She stated that it is their vision that in the next
SONA and especially in the coming State of the
Women Address, the welfare of women would be addressed.
