Teves spoke on the issue of bashing on social 
media which he had brought up during a committee 
hearing and on the need to regulate the use of social media which does not mean restricting one’s freedom of speech. Even as he has no problem with social bashing, he pointed out that what is more important to him is the identity and ccountability of the social media account holders. In this regard, Rep. Teves signified his intent to 
file a bill, for which he asked his colleagues’ support, requesting social media companies to regulate and filter social media accounts. He added that under his proposed measure, a social media entity which cannot filter a malicious account, may be held equally accountable. He said that he became a victim of social bashing on Facebook recently from a group using the name 
“Nurses for Change Movement” after he suggested a 
ban against grumpy nurses in government hospitals.
