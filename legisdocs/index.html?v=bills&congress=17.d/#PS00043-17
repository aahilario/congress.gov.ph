Gullas, Rep. Enrico A. Pineda from 1-PACMAN Party-List first emphasized the important role as well as the social and economic impact of telecommunications throughout the world, this as he noted that reliable networks could be found in top
industrialized nations while developing countries are still working diligently to attain this level.
As he observed that the Philippines has been
lagging behind in terms of internet connectivity and cellular services that it has already been outranked by its neighboring countries, he lamented that the Filipinos also suffer from costly broadband and internet charges. He thereafter emphasized the National Telecommunications Commission’s (NTC) task of reviewing and safeguarding the operations of
the telecom industry, particularly in the light of
President Rodrigo R. Duterte’s warning to
telecommunications companies (Telcos) “to shape up
or face the consequences.” He concluded that the
Filipinos deserve better services which, he hoped,
would be provided by the telcos.
