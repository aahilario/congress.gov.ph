Sarmiento talked about the unfortunate incident that happened...that caused the life \r\nof his personal driver...; believed that his driver was poisoned by carbon monoxide as the car was accidentally parked close to the gutter with the exhaust muffler and pipe obstructed by\r\nsoil. Whereupon, Rep. Sarmiento stated that he considers the staff members in the House of Representatives,... as the unsung heroes behind their legislative and district work, and that each and every one of them is indispensable to their work...; called on the House Officials, especially the Legislative Security Bureau, to impose more stringent patrolling protocols, to include car idling in excess of  30 minutes to ensure the safety and security in all areas of the House...; proposed that they be provided with a lounge where they can stay and wait until the adjournment of each session.
